### You (Message 9)

for this solution from NUance, when they say "agent" do they mean an Ai agent or a person acting as a support or customer interaction agent

---

### Assistant (Message 10)

Great question! For **Nuance Contact Center AI** by Nuance Communications, the term "agent" refers to both:

1. **AI agent**: This includes digital assistants and chatbots that automate customer interactions using conversational AI, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and natural language understanding. These virtual agents can handle customer queries, automate dialog, and provide self-service options.

2. **Human (support/customer interaction) agent**: The solution also provides real-time support and guidance to human agents. It delivers relevant information and context at the right moment during live customer interactions, enabling support staff to resolve issues more efficiently and accurately.

So, Nuance Contact Center AI supports both AI-driven automation and tools to empower human agents within a contact center setting.

Would you like more information on how it distinguishes between or integrates these two types of agents?
