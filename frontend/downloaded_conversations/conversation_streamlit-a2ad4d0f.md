### Assistant (Message 6)

Here’s what I found regarding costs and implementation timelines for **Protiviti** and **Managed Cyber Risk Reduction (MCRR) by Critical Start**:

---

### 1. **Protiviti (Protiviti)**
- **Costs:**  
  The pricing for Protiviti’s risk management solutions is variable and depends on the scope of services, the size of your organization, and specific requirements (e.g., type of risk, regulatory environment, integration needs). Typically, Protiviti provides a custom quote following a discovery or assessment phase.
- **Implementation Timeline:**  
  The timeline also varies based on the complexity and scope of the project. For a standard risk management engagement, initial assessments and strategy development may take a few weeks, with full solution implementation ranging from several weeks to a few months. Protiviti emphasizes a tailored approach, so the timeline is aligned with your business priorities and readiness.
- **Next Step:**  
  It’s recommended to schedule an initial consultation or discovery workshop with Protiviti to receive a more precise estimate tailored to your needs.

---

### 2. **Managed Cyber Risk Reduction (MCRR) by Critical Start**
- **Costs:**  
  MCRR pricing is also variable, influenced by factors such as the number of users/endpoints, the complexity of your security environment, required integrations, and service levels (e.g., 24/7 monitoring, incident response). Critical Start typically provides a custom quote after an initial assessment.
- **Implementation Timeline:**  
  Implementation can be rapid—generally ranging from a few weeks for initial deployment and integration, to ongoing support and optimization. A typical setup phase (assessment, deployment, configuration, and training) can be completed in 2–6 weeks, followed by continuous monitoring and improvement.
- **Next Step:**  
  A discovery call or assessment workshop with Critical Start is advised to clarify your requirements and receive a specific timeline and pricing estimate.
