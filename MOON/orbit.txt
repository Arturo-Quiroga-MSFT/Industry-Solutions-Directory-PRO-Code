The journey of Apollo 11 from Earth to the Moon in 1969 was a remarkable feat of engineering and orbital mechanics. The mission used a carefully planned trajectory involving multiple phases and orbits to ensure the spacecraft could escape Earth's gravity, travel to the Moon, enter lunar orbit, land on the Moon, and return safely. Below, I'll explain in detail the orbital path and key maneuvers used by Apollo 11, breaking it down into stages.

Overview of the Apollo 11 Mission Trajectory
The Apollo 11 mission involved several distinct orbital phases and maneuvers to transition between Earth and the Moon. These phases were designed to optimize fuel efficiency, ensure precise navigation, and account for the gravitational influences of both Earth and the Moon. The primary orbit types and maneuvers included:

Earth Parking Orbit: A temporary low Earth orbit (LEO) to prepare for the journey to the Moon.
Translunar Injection (TLI): A burn to escape Earth's gravity and set the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.
Translunar Coast: A free-return trajectory or near-free-return path to travel to the Moon.
Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI): A burn to enter orbit around the Moon.
Lunar Descent and Landing: Descent from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface (for the lunar module).
Lunar Ascent and Rendezvous: Return of the lunar module to lunar orbit to dock with the command module.
Transearth Injection (TEI): A burn to leave lunar orbit and return to Earth.
Transearth Coast and Reentry: The journey back to Earth and reentry into the atmosphere.
Let’s dive into each phase with details on the orbits and mechanics involved.

1. Launch and Earth Parking Orbit
Objective: Place the Apollo 11 spacecraft into a stable low Earth orbit (LEO) to prepare for the journey to the Moon.
Details:
Apollo 11 was launched on July 16, 1969, using the Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
After liftoff, the Saturn V's first and second stages propelled the spacecraft into a circular parking orbit at an altitude of approximately 185 kilometers (115 miles) above Earth's surface.
This orbit had an inclination of about 32.5 degrees to the equator, determined by the launch site's latitude and the need to align with the Moon's orbital plane.
The spacecraft (consisting of the Command/Service Module, or CSM, and the Lunar Module, or LM, still attached) remained in this orbit for about 2.5 hours (roughly 1.5 orbits) while the crew and ground control performed systems checks.
Why a Parking Orbit?:
A parking orbit allowed the spacecraft to be positioned at the right point in space and time to perform the next critical maneuver, the Translunar Injection (TLI), ensuring the trajectory would intersect with the Moon's position about three days later.
2. Translunar Injection (TLI)
Objective: Escape Earth's gravitational pull and set the spacecraft on a path toward the Moon.
Details:
After systems checks in the parking orbit, the third stage of the Saturn V (the S-IVB stage) was reignited for about 6 minutes to perform the TLI burn.
This burn increased the spacecraft's velocity to approximately 10.8 kilometers per second (24,200 mph), exceeding Earth's escape velocity of about 11.2 km/s at that altitude. This placed the spacecraft on a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee (farthest point from Earth) well beyond the Moon's distance.
The trajectory was designed to be a free-return trajectory (or near-free-return for Apollo 11), meaning that if no further maneuvers were performed, the spacecraft would loop around the Moon and return to Earth due to Earth's gravity. This was a safety measure in case of engine failure or other issues.
Orbital Mechanics:
The TLI burn transformed the circular parking orbit into a highly eccentric orbit, with the perigee (closest point to Earth) near the parking orbit altitude and the apogee far beyond the Moon's orbit (about 384,400 km from Earth on average).
The trajectory was carefully timed so that the spacecraft would reach the Moon's vicinity when the Moon was at the right position in its orbit around Earth.
3. Translunar Coast
Objective: Travel from Earth to the Moon over a period of about 3 days.
Details:
After the TLI burn, the S-IVB stage was jettisoned, and the Command/Service Module (CSM) separated, turned around, and docked with the Lunar Module (LM), which was still housed in the S-IVB stage. The CSM then extracted the LM, and the combined spacecraft continued on its journey.
During the translunar coast, the spacecraft followed a passive trajectory, influenced primarily by Earth's gravity initially, and later by the Moon's gravity as it approached.
The trajectory was not a straight line but a curved path due to the gravitational pull of both bodies. Mid-course corrections (small burns using the CSM's engines) were performed to fine-tune the path and ensure the spacecraft would arrive at the correct point for lunar orbit insertion. Apollo 11 required only one significant mid-course correction.
Free-Return Trajectory:
Early Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, used a free-return or near-free-return trajectory as a safety feature. If the Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine failed to fire for lunar orbit insertion, the spacecraft would slingshot around the Moon and return to Earth without additional propulsion.
For Apollo 11, the trajectory was slightly adjusted from a pure free-return to optimize the lunar landing site, but it still provided a reasonable return path in case of emergency.
4. Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI)
Objective: Slow down the spacecraft to be captured by the Moon's gravity and enter a stable lunar orbit.
Details:
On July 19, 1969, after about 76 hours of travel, Apollo 11 approached the Moon. The CSM's Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine was fired for about 6 minutes in a retrograde burn (opposite to the direction of travel) to reduce velocity.
This maneuver slowed the spacecraft enough to be captured by the Moon's gravity, transitioning it from a translunar trajectory to an elliptical lunar orbit with an initial altitude of about 111 km at perilune (closest point to the Moon) and 314 km at apolune (farthest point).
A second LOI burn was performed to circularize the orbit to approximately 100 km (62 miles) above the lunar surface, making it easier for the Lunar Module to descend to the landing site.
Orbital Mechanics:
The Moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's (about 1/6th), so the spacecraft needed to slow down significantly to avoid overshooting and escaping lunar orbit.
The lunar orbit was inclined relative to the Moon's equator to align with the desired landing site in the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis).
5. Lunar Descent and Landing
Objective: Separate the Lunar Module (LM) from the Command/Service Module (CSM) and land on the Moon.
Details:
On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin entered the Lunar Module "Eagle," while Michael Collins remained in the CSM "Columbia" in lunar orbit.
The LM separated from the CSM and performed a descent orbit insertion (DOI) burn to lower its perilune to about 15 km (9 miles) above the lunar surface.
The LM then executed a powered descent, using its descent stage engine to slow down and control its trajectory. Armstrong manually piloted the final approach due to unexpected boulders at the planned landing site, landing with only about 30 seconds of fuel remaining.
Landing occurred at 20:17 UTC on July 20, 1969, in the Sea of Tranquility.
Orbital Mechanics:
The descent was not a direct drop but a controlled trajectory from orbit, requiring precise timing and thrust to counteract lunar gravity and achieve a soft landing.
6. Lunar Ascent and Rendezvous
Objective: Launch the LM's ascent stage back into lunar orbit and dock with the CSM.
Details:
After about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface, the ascent stage of the LM (with Armstrong and Aldrin) launched on July 21, 1969, using the descent stage as a launch platform.
The ascent stage entered a low lunar orbit and performed maneuvers to rendezvous and dock with the CSM, which had remained in a stable orbit at about 100 km altitude.
After docking, the crew transferred back to the CSM, and the LM ascent stage was jettisoned.
Orbital Mechanics:
Rendezvous required precise calculations to match the orbits of the LM and CSM, adjusting for differences in altitude and orbital plane.
7. Transearth Injection (TEI)
Objective: Escape lunar orbit and set the spacecraft on a trajectory back to Earth.
Details:
On July 22, 1969, the CSM's SPS engine was fired for about 2.5 minutes in a prograde burn (in the direction of travel) to increase velocity and escape the Moon's gravity.
This placed the spacecraft on a transearth trajectory, a mirror image of the translunar coast, taking about 2.5 days to return to Earth.
Orbital Mechanics:
The TEI burn had to be precisely timed to ensure the spacecraft would intersect Earth's atmosphere at the correct angle for reentry.
8. Transearth Coast and Reentry
Objective: Travel back to Earth and safely reenter the atmosphere for landing.
Details:
During the transearth coast, small mid-course corrections were made to fine-tune the trajectory.
On July 24, 1969, the Service Module was jettisoned, and the Command Module (CM) oriented itself for reentry with its heat shield forward.
The CM entered Earth's atmosphere at about 11 km/s (24,600 mph), using aerodynamic drag to slow down. It deployed parachutes and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, about 1,440 km (900 miles) southwest of Hawaii.
Orbital Mechanics:
The reentry corridor (the acceptable range of angles for entering the atmosphere) was narrow. Too steep an angle would cause excessive heating and structural failure; too shallow an angle would cause the spacecraft to skip off the atmosphere.
Key Orbital Characteristics and Challenges
Three-Body Problem:
The trajectory planning for Apollo 11 had to account for the gravitational influences of Earth, the Moon, and to a lesser extent, the Sun. This is a complex "three-body problem" in orbital mechanics, solved using numerical methods and approximations (e.g., patched conic approximation).
Timing and Alignment:
The launch window and trajectory were chosen based on the relative positions of Earth and the Moon. The Moon moves about 13 degrees per day in its orbit, so timing was critical to ensure the spacecraft arrived at the right place.
Fuel Efficiency:
The free-return trajectory and other maneuvers were designed to minimize fuel use while maintaining safety. Each burn (TLI, LOI, TEI) had to be precisely calculated to avoid wasting propellant.
Navigation:
Navigation relied on ground-based tracking, onboard star sightings, and computer calculations using the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). Mid-course corrections compensated for small errors in trajectory.
Summary of Orbits Used by Apollo 11
Earth Parking Orbit: Circular low Earth orbit at ~185 km altitude.
Translunar Trajectory: Highly elliptical orbit transitioning to a free-return or near-free-return path to the Moon.
Lunar Orbit: Circular orbit at ~100 km altitude around the Moon.
Descent Orbit: Elliptical orbit for LM descent, lowering to ~15 km at perilune.
Transearth Trajectory: Return path from lunar orbit to Earth, ending in atmospheric reentry.
Conclusion
The orbital path of Apollo 11 was a masterpiece of planning and execution, relying on precise calculations of orbital mechanics, gravitational interactions, and propulsion. Each phase—Earth parking orbit, translunar injection, lunar orbit insertion, descent, ascent, and transearth injection—was critical to the mission's success. The use of a free-return trajectory provided a safety net, while mid-course corrections ensured accuracy. This mission demonstrated humanity's ability to navigate the complexities of space travel and achieve a lunar landing, paving the way for future exploration.
