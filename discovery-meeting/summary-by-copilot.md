Meeting notes:
Industry Solutions Directory Enhancement Initiative: 
Will introduced the team's stretch project to update the Microsoft Industry Solutions Directory with a search capability, outlining the current limitations and the need for a more user-friendly, searchable experience for partners and customers; Jason, Arturo, and Thomas discussed technical approaches and next steps for implementing an agentic search assistant.
	Current Directory Limitations: Will described the existing Industry Solutions Directory, noting that while partners can showcase solutions by industry and technology, there is no search functionality, requiring users to manually navigate through categories to find specific partner solutions.
	Project Goals and Quick Win Identification: Will explained that the team, following a challenge from Vice President Lori Borg, identified four potential opportunities for directory improvement, with consensus to pilot a customer-facing AI search assistant that enables natural language queries and conversational search for solutions.
	Technical Solution Approaches: Arturo and Jason discussed possible technical implementations, including classical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, Copilot Studio for low-code solutions, and pro-code approaches using Azure AI services; Thomas suggested leveraging Copilot Studio to crawl the website and supplementing with Azure search for improved accuracy.
	Data Source and Integration Requirements: Jason requested access to the source data for the directory, and Will agreed to obtain this information from the team managing the site, noting that the directory is currently externally hosted but may transition to Microsoft hosting in the future.
	Licensing and Budget Considerations: Jason raised questions about licensing models for Copilot Studio and potential budget constraints, with Will asking the team to favor realistic, cost-effective solutions and requesting cost estimates for both low-code and pro-code approaches.
Division of Technical Exploration Tasks: 
Arturo and Thomas agreed to concurrently investigate both pro-code and low-code solutions for implementing the search assistant, with Thomas focusing on Copilot Studio and Arturo on custom development, aiming to compare approaches and report on pros, cons, and costs.
	Low-Code Solution Exploration: Thomas will evaluate Copilot Studio as a low-code option, testing its ability to crawl the directory website and assessing the accuracy and reliability of its responses, as well as considering integration with Azure search for improved results.
	Pro-Code Solution Exploration: Arturo will investigate a pro-code approach, potentially using Azure AI services and custom agent development, to determine feasibility, integration complexity, and cost implications for a more tailored search assistant.
	Concurrent Evaluation and Comparison: Both approaches will be developed and tested in parallel, with the team planning to compare outcomes, document pros and cons, and present findings—including cost estimates—to inform the final implementation decision.
Ownership, Hosting, and Partner Involvement: 
Will clarified that the Industry Solutions Directory is currently externally hosted and managed by a partner, with future plans to investigate Microsoft hosting; Thomas and Jason emphasized the need to involve the hosting partner in technical discussions and site updates.
	Current Hosting Arrangements: Will explained that the directory is externally hosted by a partner, and personal information management is handled by the partner, though future internal hosting is under consideration.
	Partner Engagement for Technical Updates: Thomas recommended involving the hosting partner early in the process to ensure technical feasibility and support for publishing and refining the website, with Will agreeing to invite the partner and their technical contact to the next meeting.
Next Steps and Meeting Planning: 
Will proposed scheduling a follow-up meeting in one week using the same time slot, agreed to send a summary of action items via Teams chat, and outlined that the next session will focus on project scoping and delivery timelines.
	Follow-Up Meeting Scheduling: Will suggested reconvening in one week to review progress, with all participants agreeing to the proposed time slot and method of communication.
	Action Item Summary Distribution: Will committed to summarizing the meeting's action items and sharing them via Teams chat for record-keeping and ongoing collaboration.
	Project Scoping for Next Session: Will stated that the next meeting will focus on defining project deliverables and timelines, transitioning from discovery to concrete planning.
Follow-up tasks:
Technical Feasibility and Cost Analysis: 
Evaluate both low-code (Copilot Studio) and pro-code approaches for implementing an AI search assistant for the Industry Solutions Directory, including associated costs, and share findings with the team. (Thomas, Arturo)
Site Source and Tech Stack Information: 
Obtain and share the source and technology stack details of the Industry Solutions Directory website with the technical team. (Will)
Knowledge Source Exploration: 
Reach out to Mike Richter to gather information about the knowledge source used for the extended solution containing the universe of industry solutions. (Jason)
Partner Involvement: 
Invite the partner (Nat Collective) and their technical representative who hosts the Industry Solutions Directory to the next meeting. (Will)
AI Search Proof of Concept: 
Stage a quick AI search proof of concept using demo or POC credentials and index representative content for evaluation. (Thomas, Arturo, Jason)
Meeting Coordination: 
Schedule the next meeting for the same time slot one week from now and send a summary of action items to the team via Teams chat. (Will)
