## Methodology

**Data Source:** Azure AI Search index `partner-solutions-integrated`  
**Endpoint:** https://indsolse-dev-srch-okumlm.search.windows.net  
**Analysis Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Ingestion Process:**
1. ISD API data extraction (mssoldir-app-prd.azurewebsites.net)
2. De-duplication logic (700 entries → 539 unique solutions)
3. Blob storage export (Azure Blob in aqstorage009876)
4. Azure AI Search integrated vectorization
5. Vector embeddings (text-embedding-3-large model)

**Partner Name Normalization:**
- Combined variations (e.g., "RSM US LLP" + "RSM" → "RSM")
- Standardized naming (e.g., "Tata Consultancy Services" + "TCS" → "TCS")
- Merged related entities (e.g., "Cognizant Technology Solutions" + "Cognizant" → "Cognizant")

**Quality Thresholds:**
- Solutions must have non-empty descriptions to be fully indexed
- 49 solutions flagged with missing/empty descriptions
- All solutions retained in index for partner reference

---

## Data Quality Notes

### De-duplication Process
On December 12, 2025, we implemented a comprehensive de-duplication strategy:
- **Before:** 700 solution entries from ISD API
- **After:** 539 unique solutions (identified by solution ID)
- **Aggregation:** Combined all industry/technology appearances per solution

### Known Limitations
1. **49 solutions with warnings** - Missing or empty descriptions at source
2. **Industry taxonomy variations** - Some entries show array formatting artifacts
3. **Technology granularity** - Currently 5 categories (may expand as ISD evolves)
4. **Partner name variations** - Automated normalization may miss some edge cases

### Future Improvements
- Automated weekly refresh from ISD API
- Enhanced partner name matching using fuzzy logic
- Industry taxonomy cleanup with ISD team collaboration
- Technology category expansion as new areas emerge
- Partner tier classification (Gold, Silver, etc.)
