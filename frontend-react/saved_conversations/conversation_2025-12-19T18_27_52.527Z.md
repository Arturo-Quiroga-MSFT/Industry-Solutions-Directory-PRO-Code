## Query 1

**Question**: Core banking modernization solutions

**Result**: Found 10 results

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT solutionName, orgName, industryName, solutionAreaName, solutionDescription
FROM dbo.vw_ISDSolution_All
WHERE solutionStatus = 'Approved'
  AND industryName = 'Financial Services'
  AND (
        solutionName LIKE '%core bank%'
        OR solutionDescription LIKE '%core bank%'
        OR solutionName LIKE '%bank modern%'
        OR solutionDescription LIKE '%bank modern%'
      )
ORDER BY solutionName;
```

**Explanation**: This query returns all approved Financial Services solutions that appear to be related to core banking modernization by searching for relevant keywords in the solution name or description. Because the view is denormalized and may contain duplicates, DISTINCT is used. Required core columns are included with solutionDescription placed last.
