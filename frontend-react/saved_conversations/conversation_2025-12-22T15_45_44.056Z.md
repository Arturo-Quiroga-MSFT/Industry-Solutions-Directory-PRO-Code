## Query 4

**Question**: Which Cognizant solutions specifically leverage FHIR, Azure Cognitive Services, or OpenAI models?

**Result**: Found 7 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary  
Across Cognizant’s seven solutions, a surprisingly concentrated cluster emerges: only three offerings explicitly leverage **Azure Cognitive Services or Azure/OpenAI models**, while four tap into **FHIR-based** interoperability. Yet these few solutions punch far above their weight, revealing a company doubling down on two strategic fronts — **AI‑driven content intelligence** and **healthcare data integration** — each deployed globally and built tightly on Azure-native architecture.

## Market Landscape  
When you step back and look across the portfolio, a clear dual‑track strategy becomes visible. On one side, Cognizant leans heavily into **AI‑powered media automation**, with its Ad Moderation Solution appearing across three regions and consistently anchored by Azure Cognitive Services and OpenAI models. On the other, an equally strong push into **healthcare interoperability** becomes evident, led by solutions that embed FHIR standards either at the data-integration level or within virtual care platforms. What’s striking is not the volume of AI or FHIR-enabled solutions, but how **deliberately** Cognizant deploys them — each one supporting a high‑value, high‑complexity business scenario. The result is a portfolio that looks less like a broad catalog and more like a set of strategic bets in markets undergoing rapid digital transformation.

### Key Discoveries  
- Two solutions (29%) explicitly use Azure Cognitive Services and Azure OpenAI Services — all tied to the Cognizant Ad Moderation Solution deployed across Canada, Latin America, and the United States.  
- One solution (14%) uses FHIR — the FHIR Data Integration ETL Framework — the only solution dedicated solely to metadata-driven FHIR transformation and interoperability.  
- The Virtual Healthcare Solution for Remote Patient Monitoring (across three regions) includes FHIR API–based integration as part of its medical-grade cloud platform, expanding the total number of FHIR-enabled solutions to four.  
- Industry concentration skews heavily toward Healthcare & Life Sciences (57%), with the remaining 43% tied entirely to Media & Entertainment — a reflection of Cognizant’s bifurcated strategy.  
- Regional duplication shows intentional global scaling: the Ad Moderation and Virtual Healthcare solution families each appear in three regions.

## Strategic Insights  
Taken together, these patterns form a compelling story of a company selectively investing in domains where Azure-native AI and FHIR standards can create the most differentiation. The **content intelligence track** leans on Cognitive Services and OpenAI to handle massive unstructured media workloads — an area where automation is no longer optional. Meanwhile, the **healthcare track** reflects the accelerating demand for interoperable, cloud-based clinical ecosystems, with Cognizant positioning itself at both the operational layer (virtual care via FHIR APIs) and the integration layer (FHIR ETL). The dual-stack approach — generative AI for media, FHIR for healthcare — isn’t accidental; it signals Cognizant’s intent to dominate two industries facing urgent modernization pressures. And with every solution built atop Azure, the company is clearly aligning itself with Microsoft’s cloud and AI roadmap.

### Next Steps
