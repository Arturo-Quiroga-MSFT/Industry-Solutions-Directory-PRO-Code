## Query 1

**Question**: I'd like to know if agent based applications exist in the Solutions Directory?

**Result**: Found 50 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary

Agent-based applications are not just present—they are rapidly redefining the Solutions Directory. Out of 50 analyzed results, nearly every entry leverages agentic architecture, signalling an enterprise-wide leap beyond static copilots into dynamic, collaborative AI workflows. The transformation is led by **Adastra** and **Capgemini Technology Services Ltd**, who have carved out leadership positions in this fast-evolving, data-driven market.

## Market Landscape

The rise of agentic AI is unmistakable. The Solutions Directory reveals a tightly contested space dominated by heavyweight Microsoft partners, most notably **Adastra** and Capgemini. Adastra leads with at least five distinct entries focused on workshops and frameworks that empower organizations to build a foundational agentic approach across everything from ERP transformation to low-code AI initiatives. Capgemini, meanwhile, cements its status as a global player by wielding its 'Agentic KYC' offering across multiple solution scenarios in both Canadian and Latin American markets. What’s striking is just how fully these partners have committed to agent-based architectures: gone are the days of simple copilots—instead, we’re seeing whole ecosystems of multi-agent dynamic workflows, orchestrated via Azure AI Foundry, and deeply integrated with Microsoft’s AI stack.

### Key Discoveries

- **Adastra’s ‘Agentic AI Envisioning Workshop’ surfaces in at least five entries, ranging from Copilot integrations to ERP and low-code agent frameworks—making it an essential launchpad for organizations seeking agentic transformation.**
- **Capgemini's ‘Agentic KYC – Strategy & Implementation’ features prominently in five different use cases, especially where regulations and onboarding dominate, promising measurable reductions in operational costs and onboarding timelines.**
- **All 50 catalogued solutions are agent-based, with automation, use case mapping, and deep Copilot/Microsoft AI integrations at their core—marking a clear industry-wide pivot toward advanced agentic architectures.**
- **Capgemini’s multi-agent workflow claims specific operational gains, such as cutting onboarding times from 100 days and boosting analyst utilization while supporting compliance and governance.**
- **Geographical concentration is strongest in Canada, with Latin America as a notable secondary hub—highlighting where innovation flourishes and signaling untapped opportunities elsewhere.**

## Strategic Insights

For business leaders, the implications are profound. The agentic paradigm is moving from theoretical to practical, truly permeating enterprise solutions. This is not just about automating routine tasks; it’s about enabling intelligent agents to reason, interact, and orchestrate entire business processes—especially in highly regulated environments like financial compliance and KYC. The technical patterns consistently favor multi-agent collaboration, Copilot extensibility, and orchestration by Azure AI Foundry. Opportunities abound for organizations seeking both rapid transformation and optimized operational models. Notably, the market remains heavily clustered in Canada and Latin America, suggesting that while regional hubs have achieved high maturity, there’s a greenfield for expansion and customer engagement globally. Furthermore, consulting-driven solution architectures and envisioning workshops are emerging as the go-to deployment model, emphasizing the need for education, prioritization, and practical roadmaps to agentic adoption.

### Next Steps

- **Prioritize engagement with Adastra’s ‘Agentic AI Envisioning Workshop’ for organizations ready to embark on structured agentic transformation—especially within the Canadian market.**
- **Financial institutions facing compliance and onboarding challenges should directly review Capgemini’s ‘Agentic KYC – Strategy & Implementation’ for actionable, measurable solutions.**
- **Analyze and compare agentic solution implementations between Canada and Latin America to inform client targeting strategies and uncover readiness gaps—then extend outreach to new regions seeking agent-driven innovation.**

The message from the data could not be clearer: agentic AI is not just a trend—it's rapidly becoming the backbone of enterprise transformation. Those who move swiftly to adopt, orchestrate, and extend agent-based solutions will reap significant operational and strategic rewards.

**Suggested Follow-up Questions:**

- Show me all solutions from Adastra focused on agentic frameworks in Canada and describe their unique agent capabilities.
- List and compare Capgemini Technology Services Ltd’s Agentic KYC solutions by deployment area (Sales Transformation vs. Secure AI Productivity).

## Query 3

**Question**: Provide a detailed breakdown of which industries (where indicated) most frequently select Adastra’s agentic AI offerings within Canada.

**Result**: Found 1 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary

The Canadian agentic AI landscape paints an unexpected picture: despite Adastra’s well-known status as an AI leader, **only one agentic AI selection is recorded for Adastra in Canada**, and it’s not linked to any specific industry. This stands out as more than a data point—it’s a story about emerging technologies navigating the uncertainty between innovation and adoption, exposing clear gaps in how the market recognizes and tracks agentic AI solutions.

## Market Landscape

At a glance, you might expect established AI consultancies like Adastra to be driving broad industry uptake for advanced agentic AI solutions. Yet, the data tells a different story: **Adastra appears as the sole partner** with a documented agentic AI selection, and that selection exists in a vacuum—**no industry attribution, no clustering in a vertical, just ‘NULL’.** This could point to several realities. Perhaps agentic AI is still too new for broad deployment, or existing reporting systems have yet to catch up with swift advancements in the field. The absence of segmentation—no finance, no healthcare, no public sector—means that, at least for now, agentic AI in Canada operates outside the conventional boundaries we use to analyze enterprise tech adoption.

### Key Discoveries

- **Adastra is the single partner with a recorded agentic AI solution selection in Canada.**
- **Only one instance of agentic AI selection appears in the dataset—attributed to Adastra.**
- **No specific industry is linked to this selection; the industry field is listed as 'NULL'.**
- **Missing or incomplete industry metadata points to either limited adoption or poor reporting structures.**
- **No pattern of deployment or cross-industry clustering emerges: adoption is minimal, perhaps pilot-stage.**

## Strategic Insights

For executives monitoring the advance of agentic AI, these findings suggest we’re at an inflection point. The lack of documented industry engagement for Adastra’s offering demands a closer look: is Canada’s market truly lagging in adoption, or are we simply missing valuable signals because of **data incompleteness and reporting lags**? The reality is likely a mix. The one-off, unclassified selection implies either a pilot engagement or a solution targeted towards a horizontal problem outside traditional vertical labeling—a typical scenario in the earliest stages of emerging tech. Furthermore, buyers and sellers alike should take heed: while agentic AI carries disruptive potential across industries, today's market evidence in Canada is thin, making **direct customer problem mapping and careful fit assessment critical before investment.**

## Next Steps

1. **Engage Adastra for deeper intelligence**—clarify which industries are evaluating or deploying agentic AI, and surface additional deployments not captured in current records.
2. **Demand improved data tagging**—work with reporting teams and solution providers to ensure agentic AI selections are properly attributed, unlocking better trend visibility.
3. **Monitor closely for vertical expansion**—track new deployments and expanded industry coverage as Adastra (and competitors) move beyond proof-of-concept into scaled offerings.

The agentic AI story in Canada is just beginning—and the next chapter hinges on filling these gaps in visibility, thereby enabling more robust strategic planning and market activation.

**Suggested Follow-up Questions:**

- Show all solutions from Adastra with detailed industry attribution within Canada, if available.
- Can we identify industry trends for agentic AI offerings in other regions compared to Canada?
- What is the adoption pattern of agentic AI solutions from Adastra in sectors like financial services or healthcare?
- Are there other partners in Canada with agentic AI solutions targeting specific industries?
