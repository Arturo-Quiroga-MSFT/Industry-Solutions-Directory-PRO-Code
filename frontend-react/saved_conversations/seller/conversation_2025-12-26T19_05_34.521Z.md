## Query 1

**Question**: What financial services solutions help with risk management?

**Result**: Found 50 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary

Risk management in financial services is rapidly evolving, with a few expert partners—especially **DXC Technology, Capgemini, DataArt, and Delinea**—shaping the competitive landscape. The crucial trend? The convergence of **generative AI** and **cloud-native architectures** to deliver sophisticated, agile risk solutions tightly coupled with Microsoft Azure security. DXC Technology, with wide-reaching OpenAI integrations, stands out as the clear frontrunner, but a handful of innovative challengers are pushing the boundaries.

## Market Landscape

Today's financial services sector faces rising complexity in risk—from regulatory compliance to cyber threats and operational pitfalls. The current market is notably **consolidated**, with most robust risk management offerings coming from a very small set of highly specialized vendors. **DXC Technology** leads not only in raw solution volume but also in global reach, deploying their OpenAI-powered services across continents. **Capgemini** and **DataArt** leverage automation and generative AI for streamlined collaborative workflows and predictive analytics, while **Delinea** delivers deep integration with Microsoft Sentinel and Azure for privileged access management. These solutions are not just secure—they are undeniably scalable, cloud-first, and "smart" in ways that were rare even a year ago.

### Key Discoveries

- **DXC Technology's OpenAI Integration Service** is prevalent in at least three distinct regions (Canada, Latin America, United States), highlighting a powerful global footprint in AI-driven security and risk management for financial services.
- **Capgemini’s Bank Guarantee Collaboration** solution automates critical banking workflows, reducing operational risk and legal bottlenecks, with deployments in North America.
- **DataArt’s platforms leverage GenAI** for real-time risk assessment and predictive analytics, enabling institutions to react instantly to market, credit, or operational risk signals.
- **Delinea’s Azure Privileged Access Management** integrates with Sentinel for adaptive, centralized account security, directly supporting compliance and scalability requirements.
- The **dominant architectural pattern** is cloud-native, favoring deep Microsoft integrations (Azure, Sentinel, Power Platform) and SaaS models for rapid scaling and regulatory response.

## Strategic Insights

This market is telling us something clear: **AI and cloud are now table stakes for risk management in financial services.** The integration of generative AI—and specifically OpenAI-powered tools as seen with DXC—signals a new bar for real-time analytics, automation, and responsiveness. Partners that combine **security with deep business process automation** (Capgemini) or predictive analytics (DataArt) are carving out niches in compliance-heavy sectors that demand operational agility. The heavy use of Microsoft Cloud-native architectures isn't simply technical preference; it’s a strategic move, ensuring scalability, resilience, and regulatory peace of mind. For decision-makers, this narrows partner options but raises expectations—solutions must be both smart and "always-on," with seamless Azure integration.

### Next Steps

1. **Engage with DXC Technology** for advanced, regionalized AI risk management—especially if global scalability and Microsoft partnership are priorities.
2. **Evaluate Capgemini and DataArt** for clients needing operational automation or cutting-edge, GenAI-driven analytics—including bespoke tools for specific banking workflows.
3. **Assess Delinea’s PAM platform** if privileged account security, compliance, and adaptive control are central to your risk strategy, and actively benchmark how partners integrate Microsoft Sentinel and Azure capabilities against your needs.

---

The bottom line? The risk management market isn't just about keeping banks safe anymore; it's become a proving ground for cognitive automation, real-time response, and cloud-native resilience. The savviest financial institutions will choose solutions that ride the wave of AI and Microsoft Cloud—before the competition turns risk into opportunity.

## Query 2

**Question**: What agent-based applications exist in the Solutions Directory?

**Result**: Found 50 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary

Agent-based AI is reshaping the Microsoft partner ecosystem, sparking rapid growth in intelligent, autonomous applications that extend far beyond 'copilots.' **Adastra** and **Capgemini Technology Services Ltd** have carved out leading roles, with Adastra’s diverse transformation workshops and Capgemini’s industry-focused KYC automations setting the pace for innovation. The most important takeaway: agentic applications are not just experimental—they’re driving real-world change for customers, with measurable business value and mounting demand, especially in North America.

## Market Landscape

The competitive terrain for agent-based applications is both dynamic and concentrated. **Adastra** leads the narrative, introducing an impressive portfolio of 20 agent-based workshops that help organizations rethink everything from ERP to Low Code AI adoption. These are not generic technology demos—they’re comprehensive frameworks, tailored to the practical challenges of business transformation. Next in line, **Capgemini Technology Services Ltd** has zeroed in on financial services, using multi-agent AI to dramatically simplify KYC and compliance, with proven results like a 50% labor reduction.

What’s particularly striking is the clustering of these solutions. Nearly half of all agentic offerings take the form of frameworks or bundled workshops, rather than standalone software. And ecosystem alignment is unmistakable: nearly every solution embraces Microsoft’s AI, Copilot, and Azure AI Foundry stacks, ensuring their relevance (and ease of deployment) for Microsoft customers. Geographically, there’s an emerging “hub” effect—over 70% of agentic solutions are concentrated in Canada, with notable early adoption in Latin America.

### Key Discoveries

- **Adastra is the top contributor**, offering 20 agent-based workshops targeting transformation scenarios in ERP, Sales, Low Code AI, and Copilot adoption.
- **Capgemini Technology Services Ltd** leads with at least 10 agentic KYC solutions for banking, boasting up to 50% labor reduction and 89% user experience improvements through automated multi-agent workflows.
- **Over 90% of solutions leverage Microsoft AI, Copilot, and Azure AI Foundry**, positioning agentic applications as core to the Microsoft business solutions strategy.
- **Geographic concentration:** 70% of agentic solutions are in Canada, 10% in Latin America—highlighting North America as the epicenter of agentic experimentation and uptake.
- **Most offerings are strategic engagements** (workshops or frameworks) rather than standalone technical products, signaling a practical, transformation-focused deployment model.

## Strategic Insights

For decision-makers, the strategic implications couldn’t be clearer. Agentic AI has made the leap from theoretical possibility to actionable, scalable business impact. The dominance of multi-agent solutions—particularly those delivered as workshops or frameworks—reflects deep customer demand for practical, implementation-ready pathways, not mere technology demonstrations. The close alignment with Microsoft AI and Copilot ecosystems amplifies integration potential, retargeting traditional process automation for the era of intelligent agents.

Adastra’s specialization across business transformation verticals makes them an invaluable partner for sellers looking to craft bespoke solutions—every workshop is a blueprint for rapid adoption. Capgemini’s KYC suite is a case study in agentic ROI, offering regulators and banks not just productivity, but real compliance wins. Yet, the geographic and industry concentration means there’s room to diversify—emerging markets and less represented verticals offer untapped potential where agentic frameworks could deliver outsized value.

The rise of agentic frameworks and strategic engagement models signals a broader technology trend: companies aren’t just experimenting—they’re integrating agentic AI for mission-critical transformation, with consulting plays evolving as the primary deployment model.

### Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Adastra workshops** for sellers seeking scalable, actionable agentic frameworks in verticals like ERP, Sales, and Low Code AI.
2. **Explore Capgemini’s KYC suite** for deep dives into automation and compliance in regulated industries—quantify potential ROI and user experience gains for key accounts.
3. **Identify gaps in regional and industry coverage**, reaching out to partners in underserved segments to expand Microsoft’s agentic value proposition and ensure inclusive growth.

Agent-based AI isn’t on the horizon—it’s here and it’s changing the Microsoft solution landscape. The next wave of intelligent business transformation will be powered by these collaborative digital agents, fueled by proven frameworks and ready for global scale.

**Suggested Follow-up Questions:**

- Show me all agentic solutions offered by Adastra, including their transformation focus areas.
- Compare Capgemini's agentic KYC implementations for Canada vs Latin America: what are the differences in coverage and capabilities?
- What percentage of agentic applications use Azure AI Foundry vs Power Platform AI Builder, based on solution descriptions?

## Query 3

**Question**: Provide a detailed breakdown of which industries have Adastra's agentic AI offerings

**Result**: Found 80 results

### 💡 Insights

## Executive Summary

Adastra’s agentic AI portfolio is a bold departure from the playbook of industry-focused competitors. Rather than tailoring solutions for healthcare, finance, or manufacturing, Adastra champions **universality**—delivering agentic AI enablement that transcends verticals, and empowers organizations of any stripe to chart their own transformation journeys. The numbers confirm: Adastra’s offerings are mapped to 'NULL' industry codes in every instance—a strategic signal to the market.

## Market Landscape

In a market where most partners carve out niches—optimizing AI for supply chain, patient care, or fraud detection—Adastra stands apart. Its **Agentic AI Envisioning Workshop**, the flagship offering, is positioned as a platform-agnostic accelerator for cross-industry enterprise adoption. This is not a common strategy. Others are striving for depth in specific verticals, while Adastra approaches agentic AI as the connective tissue for organizational change, with solutions clustered not by sector, but by **business function and technology maturity**. Notably, Adastra’s reach is entirely within North America, with equal footing in the United States and Canada.

### Key Discoveries

- **100% of Adastra agentic AI solutions are tagged ‘NULL’ for industry**, affirming a horizontal, cross-vertical approach.
- The **Agentic AI Envisioning Workshop** features consistently across distinct solution plays—'Copilot and Agents at Work', 'Innovate with Low Code AI and Agents', and 'Service Transformation with AI'—rather than industry verticals.
- No explicit connections are made to healthcare, financial services, retail, or manufacturing; descriptions emphasize **business-wide automation, incident response, and AI governance**.
- Adastra segments solutions by **solution plays**, such as business transformation or technology adoption, rather than by customer industry.
- The entire observed agentic AI portfolio is split evenly between the US and Canadian regions, indicating a focus on regional breadth rather than vertical specialization.

## Strategic Insights

Adastra’s positioning holds important implications for decision makers. By anchoring agentic AI to foundational frameworks—**governance, business process integration, and risk mitigation around Microsoft AI investments**—Adastra offers a compelling proposition for organizations wary of “AI sprawl” and piecemeal deployment. The workshop-centric, consulting-led delivery signals readiness to scale across business functions, rather than lock into single-industry constraints. However, this universality is a double-edged sword: buyers seeking deep domain expertise (for regulatory-driven verticals, for instance) may need more tailored approaches. For enterprises at the early stages of AI integration, Adastra emerges as a strategic advisor—an architect of future capabilities, not just a vendor of software. This horizontal strategy invites the possibility of customization, adaptation, and enterprise-wide learning cycles.

### Next Steps

1. **Position Adastra as an agentic AI foundation partner** for clients seeking organization-wide readiness rather than siloed, niche solutions.
2. **Analyze comparative strengths**: contrast Adastra’s workshops against vertical-focused competitors to spot gaps or opportunities for vertical depth.
3. **Leverage Adastra’s brand on governance and integration**: use the workshop’s versatility as a conversation starter with clients worried about fragmented AI deployments or lack of a unified strategy.

In sum: Adastra’s market bet is on being your AI transformation backbone, not your outsourced vertical specialist. For executives aiming to “future-proof” their organization, this is both a strategic advantage and a guidepost for next steps.

**Suggested Follow-up Questions:**

- Show me all agentic AI solutions from Adastra that target named vertical industries—are there any, and how do they differ from the cross-industry workshop?
- Compare Adastra's cross-industry agentic AI workshops with vertical-specific offerings from partners like Avanade or EY in Financial Services or Healthcare.
- What Adastra solutions are available for agentic AI in Canada versus the United States—are there any regional customizations or thematic differences in solution plays?
- Which other Microsoft partners are similarly focused on AI governance and unified agentic frameworks, and how do their solution architectures compare to Adastra's?
