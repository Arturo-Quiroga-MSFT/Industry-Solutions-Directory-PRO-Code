    "1. ✅ **Industry Menu API** - Retrieved complete industry hierarchy\n",
    "2. ✅ **Theme Details API** - Fetched solutions for specific themes\n",
    "3. ✅ **Data Parsing** - Extracted and structured solution information\n",
    "4. ✅ **Partner Extraction** - Parsed partner names from solution titles\n",
    "5. ✅ **Analysis** - Analyzed partner and industry distributions\n",
    "6. ✅ **Content Inspection** - Examined description characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ISD API uses a **two-phase approach**: Menu → Theme Details\n",
    "- Partner names are typically embedded in solution titles (\"Solution by Partner\")\n",
    "- Solution descriptions are HTML formatted and vary in length (500-5000+ chars)\n",
    "- Each solution has a unique ID and URL slug for direct access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run `integrated-vectorization/` scripts to index all solutions\n",
    "- Use `update-monitor/` scripts to detect changes\n",
    "- Query indexed data via the FastAPI backend\n",
